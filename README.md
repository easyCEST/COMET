# COMET
By inputting low-resolution Zspectra images，and only a few KEY offsets of High-res.， COMET achieves 8-fold Super Resolution, providing accurate quantitative maps. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286894

Overview of the COMET. The inputs are several HR CEST-MRI images at key frequency offsets Y and LR CEST-MRI images with dense frequency offsets on Z-spectra X. The output is HR CEST-MRI image with dense frequency offsets on Z-spectra Z.
